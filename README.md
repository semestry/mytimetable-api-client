MyTimetable API Client
======================

This project provides a very basic MyTimetable API client, which fetches the upcoming events for a specific user.
It is used by the MyTimetable building block for Blackboard Learn and the MyTimetable tool for Sakai.

Usage
-----

The API is a bit rough, and some of the Blackboard/Sakai components are leaking through, but it should be
good enough for general use. You need a MyTimetable 'elevated' API token and the URL of the MyTimetable API.

```java
Configuration config = new Configuration();
config.getApiEndpointUris().add("https://demo.mytimetable.net/api/v0/");
config.setApiKey("MY-API-KEY");

// Create the MyTimetable service class
// Object is thread-safe and can be used by multiple threads
MyTimetableService service = new MyTimetableServiceImpl(config);

upcomingEvents = service.getUpcomingEvents(username);

// Release after use (e.g., in ContextListener)
service.close();
```

Availability
------------

The library is available from our Maven repo. Example Gradle config:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        url "https://maven.eveoh.nl/content/repositories/releases"
    }
}

dependencies {
    compile "nl.eveoh.mytimetable:mytimetable-api-client:1.1.4"
}
```

Logging
-------

Some logging is done using [slf4j](www.slf4j.org), you can use any compatible logger to get the messages. Internally
[Apache HttpClient](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/) is used, which uses commons-logging. Try the
`jcl-over-slf4j` package to push these messages to your slf4j logger.
